										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>About</strong><strong>:</strong> Ector County Independent School District (ECISD) in Odessa, Texas, used Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) funding to close learning gaps by delivering high-impact tutoring and measuring impact using MAP<sup>®</sup> Growth<sup><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></sup> assessment data.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Texas House Bill 4545 requires accelerated instruction for students who do not pass the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness (STAAR) exam.</p>
<p>The trustees and administrators of ECISD decided to use their federal ESSER funds to vet and hire tutoring companies to provide small-group, focused instruction, and to pay them based on the results they achieved. Yet, how would these results be measured?</p>
<p>“Most districts were spending millions of ESSER dollars on passive logins to learning sites. We weren’t about to do that. But because we invested in virtual tutoring, we had to make sure that the implementation was quality. So the milestones that we established with NWEA’s help really set the stage.”</p>
<p>—Dr. Lilia Nanez, ECISD Associate Superintendent of Curriculum and Instruction</p>
<p><strong>The remedy: </strong>Ector County selected MAP Growth as a consistent, growth-focused measure of achievement. With data-sharing agreements in place with the tutoring firms, sharing student growth results was seamless, allowing for immediate intervention and celebration as well as data-driven incentives. With an understanding that growth leads to proficiency, the district worked with NWEA to target specific data.</p>
<div style="padding: 15px 0px 15px;">
<div style="padding: 15px; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;">
<p><em>“Our goal was to focus on growth because so many of our kids were two or more grade levels below. The most profound data was our early years: kindergartners, first, and second. I think I had to give Dr. Scott Muri, our superintendent, CPR when we saw where we were a year ago! And then fast forward to winter of ‘22 and we hit the target in kindergarten and closed the gaps in first and second grade. That&#8217;s a lot to celebrate—you can see that we’re making progress.”</em></p>
<p style="font-size: 14.5px;">-Dr. Lilia Nanez, ECISD Associate Superintendent of Curriculum and Instruction</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This measured progress leads to focused instruction, and the reporting of data to the contracted tutoring firms ensures that students have an individualized profile on their learning gaps. Teachers and students can have intentional conversations, setting learning goals together and updating them throughout the year.</p>
<p>With dedicated PLC (Professional Learning Community) and DDI (Data Driven Instruction and Inquiry) meetings throughout the year, Ector County uses MAP data to launch discussions over learned versus taught curriculum, breaking down standards and teaching model lessons.</p>
<div style="padding: 15px 0px 15px;">
<div style="padding: 15px; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;">
<p><em>“We may have a student that is a grade level or two below on MAP, so we work on breaking down that reporting category for those students. We determine what needs to be retaught. MAP is like our oil change, three times a year.”</em></p>
<p style="font-size: 14.5px;">-Dr. Lilia Nanez, ECISD Associate Superintendent of Curriculum and Instruction</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Ector County seniors who participated in district-provided SAT boot camps raised their reading and writing scores from an average of 468 to 485, setting them above state norms for the first time in the district’s history. Teachers are advocating for even more high-quality data to inform instructional decisions for all students—at, above, or below grade level—so that responsive teaching becomes more focused, intentional, and student-specific. With this data comes the power of ongoing, measurable goals. For actionable goal-setting tips, view the NWEA webinar <a href="https://www.nwea.org/resource-center/resource/goals-mean-growth-using-student-goal-setting-to-jumpstart-student-motivation-and-success/">“Goals mean growth: Using student goal setting to jumpstart student motivation and success.”</a></p>
<div style="padding: 15px 0px 15px;">
<div style="padding: 15px; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;">
<p><em>“We have principals who swear by NWEA data. Even the children, themselves, will run up to a principal and say, ‘Ms. Arandas, I went up 9 RIT points on my MAP!’ Now teachers and kids set their individual goals, and teachers take that time to sit with the kids and set new data-driven goals for the next administration. I’ll never forget a 16-year-tenured board member hearing all of this and saying, ‘The only time ECISD has been above the state was negative things.’ She was shaking her head like she couldn&#8217;t believe it.”</em></p>
<p style="font-size: 14.5px;">—Dr. Lilia Nanez, ECISD Associate Superintendent of Curriculum and Instruction</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Looking ahead:</strong> With trustworthy MAP Growth data to report on a high-profile tutoring initiative, ECISD’s proven results have garnered national attention and set the district on a path toward focused, intentional, confident instruction—launching its students into a brighter future.</p>
