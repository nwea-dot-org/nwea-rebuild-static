										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Miles Davison specializes in using quantitative and mixed-methodologies to examine how K-12 intervention policies and programs impact equity in schools. His research is driven by a desire to assist schools in creating optimal learning environments for students. He is particularly interested in understanding how particular processes and mechanisms associated with school policies ultimately impact student behavioral and academic outcomes.&nbsp; Specifically, his recent work has focused on changes in school disciplinary practices and disparities after the implementation of restorative justice policies. Through this work, Miles has gained a passion for producing research that is actionable and relevant to policymakers and practitioners.</p>
<p>Dr. Davison holds a PhD in sociology from the University of California, Irvine.</p>
