										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Teresa Krastel, PhD, is the Spanish solution lead at NWEA. A linguist by training, she brings over 10 years of experience in assessment and educational publishing and 15 years of teaching experience at the middle and high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels. Teresa earned her doctorate in Hispanic literatures and linguistics, with a focus on second language acquisition, applied linguistics, bilingualism, and dialectology. Teresa and the Spanish team hope to engage further with Spanish MAP Growth and Spanish MAP Reading Fluency partners to understand their use cases and needs and to improve test quality. She is passionate about creating culturally responsive, native Spanish-language assessments to help ensure access and accuracy in measuring the growth of native Spanish-speaking children and seeks to promote advocacy and equity for English language learners.</p>
