										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Miles Davison specializes in using quantitative and mixed-methodologies to examine how K-12 intervention policies and programs impact equity in schools. His research is driven by a desire to assist schools in creating optimal learning environments for students. He is particularly interested in understanding how particular processes and mechanisms associated with school policies ultimately impact student behavioral and academic outcomes.&nbsp; Specifically, his recent work has focused on changes in school disciplinary practices and disparities after the implementation of restorative justice policies. Through this work, Miles has gained a passion for producing research that is actionable and relevant to policymakers and practitioners.</p>
<p>Dr. Davison holds a PhD in sociology from the University of California, Irvine.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Emily Morton specializes in using quantitative methodologies to examine academic and developmental impacts of myriad policies and programs on students. Her research interests center around estimating the effects of K-12 education policies and programs related to school schedules, instructional time, and learning environments on student achievement and youth development, and understanding the processes involved in promoting positive youth and human development across the lifespan. She uses applied econometrics and causal inference as well as qualitative methodologies to investigate these topics. She conducts much of her research in partnership with schools and districts, with the intention of producing actionable findings that will directly inform policy and practice and serve to reduce inequality. Most notably, her recent work focuses on examining impacts of the four-day school week on student outcomes.</p>
<p>Dr. Morton holds a PhD in education policy and an MPP from Stanford University.</p>
