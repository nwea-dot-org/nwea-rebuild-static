										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Helena Connolly is a learning scientist whose research focuses on math and science learning, non-routine problem solving, motivation, and teacher adaptivity. Helena primarily conducts experimental and mixed methods research with K-12 students and teachers. As a former elementary school teacher, Helena seeks to understand various pedagogical approaches and how they affect individual learners. Prior to joining NWEA, Helena explored these questions as a research fellow at the Institute for Learning Technologies at Teachers College, Columbia University, where she earned a PhD in cognitive science in education.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Emily Morton specializes in using quantitative methodologies to examine academic and developmental impacts of myriad policies and programs on students. Her research interests center around estimating the effects of K-12 education policies and programs related to school schedules, instructional time, and learning environments on student achievement and youth development, and understanding the processes involved in promoting positive youth and human development across the lifespan. She uses applied econometrics and causal inference as well as qualitative methodologies to investigate these topics. She conducts much of her research in partnership with schools and districts, with the intention of producing actionable findings that will directly inform policy and practice and serve to reduce inequality. Most notably, her recent work focuses on examining impacts of the four-day school week on student outcomes.</p>
<p>Dr. Morton holds a PhD in education policy and an MPP from Stanford University.</p>

<p>Erik Ruzek’s research focuses on how classroom and school processes shape student engagement, motivation, and learning. As an educational psychologist, his work emphasizes the measurement of students&#8217; subjective experiences of their classrooms and school.&nbsp; He combines student-reported experiential data with classroom observations, teacher reports, and direct assessments to identify the essential features of teacher-student and student-peer interactions that engage and motivate students.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Ruzek also has conducted research on early childhood education. He is co-investigator of a longitudinal study of preschool through early elementary school funded by the Institute of Education Sciences. His most recent work in this area includes the development and validation of a motivation survey for preschool through second grade students.</p>



<p>Before joining NWEA, Dr. Ruzek was a research professor in the Center for Advanced Study of Teaching and Learning, which is housed within the School of Education and Human Development at the University of Virginia. He earned a PhD in educational policy and social context from University of California, Irvine, CA. Prior to getting his PhD, he was a college admissions counselor for different University of California and California State University campuses.</p>
