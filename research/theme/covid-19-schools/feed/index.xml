										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ayesha K. Hashim draws on interdisciplinary and mixed-methods research designs to study the impacts of district-level school policies on student learning, as well as the leadership, organizational, and implementation conditions that can explain observed results.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Erin Fahle investigates how social and school context affects gender, racial/ethnic, and socioeconomic inequalities in student’s access to educational opportunities and subsequent achievement. Dr. Fahle’s goal is to help states, districts, and schools identify areas for policy and practice interventions that can improve the educational circumstances of children across the U.S. She believes deeply that this work must be done in partnership with school leaders and is committed to designing research that reflects their perspectives. Her work has been published in <em>Educational Researcher</em> and the <em>American Educational Research Journal</em> and featured in media outlets including the <em>New York Times</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and NPR.</p>
<p>Dr. Fahle also serves as the co-director of the <a href="https://edopportunity.org/">Educational Opportunity Project</a>. This initiative, led by Stanford University, aims to make high-quality data and research on U.S. educational opportunity widely accessible to policymakers, practitioners, and parents. Prior to joining NWEA, Dr. Fahle was an assistant professor at St. John’s University. She holds a PhD in education policy from Stanford University and an MS in applied mathematics and statistics from Georgetown University.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Miles Davison specializes in using quantitative and mixed-methodologies to examine how K-12 intervention policies and programs impact equity in schools. His research is driven by a desire to assist schools in creating optimal learning environments for students. He is particularly interested in understanding how particular processes and mechanisms associated with school policies ultimately impact student behavioral and academic outcomes.&nbsp; Specifically, his recent work has focused on changes in school disciplinary practices and disparities after the implementation of restorative justice policies. Through this work, Miles has gained a passion for producing research that is actionable and relevant to policymakers and practitioners.</p>
<p>Dr. Davison holds a PhD in sociology from the University of California, Irvine.</p>
